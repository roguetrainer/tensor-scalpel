## **Primary Sources (Multiverse Computing & DeepSeek)**

**1\. The Foundation: CompactifAI**

* **Title:** *CompactifAI: Extreme Compression of Large Language Models using Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks*  
* **Authors:** Tomut, A., Jahromi, S. S., et al. (Multiverse Computing)  
* **Date:** May 2024 (arXiv:2401.14109)  
* **Key Contribution:** Proved that LLM layers (Llama-2) can be replaced by Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) to reduce parameters by 70% with minimal accuracy loss.

**2\. The Bridge: Disentanglers**

* **Title:** *Quantum large language models via tensor network disentanglers*  
* **Authors:** Aizpurua, B., Jahromi, S. S., Singh, S., Orús, R.  
* **Date:** October 2024 (arXiv:2410.17397)  
* **Key Contribution:** Introduced the concept of "Disentanglers"—using tensor networks to separate different types of information (e.g., Knowledge vs. Style/Bias). This is the theoretical basis for "De-censorship."

**3\. The Targeting System: Domain-Aware Search**

* **Title:** *Domain-Aware Tensor Network Structure Search*  
* **Date:** September 2025 (arXiv:2505.23537)  
* **Key Contribution:** Demonstrated using LLMs to guide the compression process, allowing researchers to target specific "domains" (like political sensitivity) for removal or preservation.

## **Theoretical Background (Tensor Networks)**

**4\. The "Bible" of Tensor Networks**

* **Title:** *A Practical Introduction to Tensor Networks: Matrix Product States and Projected Entangled Pair States*  
* **Author:** Román Orús  
* **Date:** 2014 (Annals of Physics)  
* **Relevance:** The fundamental textbook explaining MPOs, Bond Dimensions, and the physics behind the code.

**5\. Tensorizing Neural Networks**

* **Title:** *Tensorizing Neural Networks*  
* **Authors:** Novikov, A., et al.  
* **Date:** 2015 (NeurIPS)  
* **Relevance:** The early work showing that dense layers in neural networks can be replaced by Tensor Trains (TT-Format).
