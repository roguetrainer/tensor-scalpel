**Headline:** Did Quantum Physicists just "lobotomize" a massive AI model? ⚛️🧠

You might have seen the headlines: Researchers at MULTIVERSE COMPUTING have shrunk the massive DEEPSEEK R1 model by 50% AND surgically removed its censorship filters using "QUANTUM-INSPIRED" math. 👏

It sounds like sci-fi, but it’s actually "just" ELEGANT LINEAR ALGEBRA.

Peek at the repo to get an albeit much simplified flavour of how this works mathematically.

### **THE BREAKDOWN:**

Traditional AI treats a neural network as a giant grid of isolated numbers (Matrices). It's effective, but bloated.

Physicists view complex systems as webs of **CORRELATIONS** (Tensor Networks).

By reshaping the AI's "brain" into a **MATRIX PRODUCT OPERATOR (MPO)**—a structure originally designed to model quantum particles—we can do two incredible things:

1. **THE SHRINK RAY:** Compress the model by 50-70% by keeping only the "high-entanglement" connections and discarding the noise (Bond Dimension Truncation).  
2. **THE SCALPEL:** Identify specific behaviors (like censorship) as distinct mathematical vectors and "ablate" them using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### **In this repo:**

* **NOTEBOOK 1:** See a "Censorship Virus" injected into GPT-2 and then surgically removed using SVD.  
* **NOTEBOOK 2:** Watch a Neural Network layer get crushed by 50% using MPO reshaping.  
* **THEORY GUIDe:** A layman's guide to why brains behave like quantum states.

Did Quantum Physicists really "de-censor" a Chinese AI model? ⚛️🇨🇳  
The headlines about DeepSeek R1 are wild, but the math is even cooler.  
I built a demo to show you how "Tensor Networks" can surgically edit AI brains.

The Concept:  
Standard AI models are massive blocks of numbers (Matrices). They are huge and hard to edit.  
Physicists use "Tensor Networks" (MPOs) to model quantum entanglement.  
Turns out, you can map a Neural Network to a Quantum State. 🤯

The "Lobotomy":  
When a model is heavily censored, that behavior isn't random. It's a strong mathematical signal—a "Singular Value" that screams louder than the others.  
Using SVD, we can find that specific vector and zero it out. The knowledge stays; the refusal behavior vanishes.  
4/5  
The Compression:  
By converting the model into a "Tensor Train," we can throttle the "Bond Dimension" (the bandwidth between tensors).  
We keep the logic, drop the noise, and shrink the model by 50%.  
This is how DeepSeek R1 Slim fits on consumer hardware.  
5/5  
I wrote a Python package to demo this on GPT-2.  
You can run the surgery yourself on your laptop.
